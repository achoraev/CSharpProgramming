Strings are collections of characters. Strings are actualy char arrays.
Strings are readOnly - That means that they cannot be modified.
If you want to modify string - you must create new string and copy 
all of the old characters to it - together with the new characters

Strings are referal type of object in C#. That means that they use 
the Heap memory for storage.

One of the most important String Methods are:
 - Split: this one splits the string into other string[] array 
	based on specified delimiter
 - IndexOf: Returns the position (index) of the first occurance 
	of the specified character or substring
 - Concat / Join: You can concatenate or join multiple strings 
	onto one with specific delimiter of desired
 - Replace: It replaces specific substring with new one
 - Length: This one returns the length of the string(the length 
	of the char[] array)
 - Substring: Crop part of the string based on Starting index and 
	crop length
 - ToUpper, ToLower - self explanatory. Uppers or Lowers the case
 	of the string.
 - Trim, TrimEnd, TrimStart: Removes the whitespace at the start
	 and at the end of the string
 - Padleft and PadRight - Trimming a string removes extra characters
 	on either end. Padding a string instead adds extra characters.
