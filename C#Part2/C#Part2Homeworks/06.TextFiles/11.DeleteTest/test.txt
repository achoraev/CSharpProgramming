A  or examination is an assessment intended to measure a -taker's knowledge, skill, 
aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs). A  may be
administered orally, on paper, on a computer, or in a confined area that requires a  taker to 
physically perform a set of skills. Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. For example, in a closed
book , a  taker is often required to rely upon memory to respond to specific items whereas in an
open book , a  taker may use one or more supplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator
when responding to an item. A  may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal 
 would be a reading  administered by a parent to a child. An example of a formal  would be a final 
examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an I.Q.  administered by a psychologist in a clinic.
Formal  often results in a grade or a  score.[1] A  score may be interpreted with regards to a
norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants.
