The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or
 with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard,
 and by reading text output from the computer terminal. For example, in the Windows 
operating system, the console is called the Command Prompt window and accepts MS-DOS 
commands. The Console class provides basic support for applications that read characters 
from, and write characters to, the console.
